<p><b>How it affects women</b></p>

<em>Males</em> tend to have the hyperactive/impulsive kind, which may cause them to be fidgety, always on the go, interrupt others, feel restless, talk a lot, make snap decisions, have mood swings, and be impatient.
<br></br>
<em>Females</em> have a tendency to exhibit the inattentive type, which makes it hard to focus, pay attention to details, stay organized, listen, and remember things. ADHD may be chalked up to personality rather than symptoms.

<b>Symptoms:</b>
<br></br>
People with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development:
Three types: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and a combination of the two.

Inattention: is not being able to carefully complete a task, pay attention, think about, listen to, or watch someone or something.
Impulsivity: Acting on sudden desires, ideas, or feelings rather than from careful thought.
<br></br>
<b>Understanding ADHD Symptoms in Women</b>
<br></br>
Here are some ways that ADHD might show up in your life:

<ul type="square">
<li>Your desk at work is piled high with papers. Even when you make a big effort to tidy it, it only stays clear for a day or two.
Being at the office feels difficult. The noise and people make it hard to get work done. </li>
<li>You often stay late at the office, as the only time you can work well is when everyone else has left and it's quiet.</li>
<li>You spend a lot of time and effort to look "normal," and hope no one notices the real you.</li>
<li>You feel like you're drowning in paper. At work, home, in your car, and even in your purse. You have an uneasy feeling that unpaid bills and forgotten projects are hiding under the paper.</li>
<li>You dislike going to parties and other social gatherings because they make you feel overwhelmed and shy.</li>
<li>Your mind drifts during conversations unless you're the one talking or it's a topic you find very interesting.</li>
<li>Friendships can be difficult to navigate because social rules seem complicated.</li>
<li>You talk more than anyone else you know.</li>
<li>Growing up, you were always described as a tomboy because you had so much energy and liked to be busy.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Many women are relieved to learn that behaviors they have been struggling with for so long are because of ADHD.</em></p>

Other conditions can also be present along with ADHD.
When you have more than one condition, they are called
<em>comorbid conditions</em> or coexisting conditions. Here are some conditions that women often have in addition to their ADHD:

<ul type="sqare">
<li>Substance use disorders, such as alcohol or drugs</li>
<li>Sleep disorders</li>
<li>Eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia</li>
<li>Mood disorders, like depression or bipolar disorder</li>
</ul>


<p><b>How to seek medical health:</b></p>
If you think you might have ADHD, it's important to be diagnosed by a healthcare professional. An accurate diagnosis and treatment will allow you to get relief from your symptoms and greatly improve the quality of your life.
