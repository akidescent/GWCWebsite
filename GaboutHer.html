      Our purpose is:
        </h3>

            <p>
              to bring awareness of mental health to the lives of women.
              Being young women, we understand how much pressure we are put through in society, and the significance of recognizing
              and understanding personal mental health in a informative and positive way. We also understand how hard it
              can be finding information and credible hotlines for mental health awareness, and wished to provide a constructive platform in which
              reliable information may be compiled for the benefit of our audience.
            </p>
