<br></br>

<p><f><b>How it affects women</b></p></f>

  <em>Males</em> tend to have the hyperactive/impulsive kind, which may cause them to be fidgety, interrupt others, have mood swings, and be impatient.
<br></br>
  <em>Females</em> have a tendency to exhibit the inattentive type, which makes it hard to focus, pay attention to details, listen, and remember things.

<f><b>Symptoms:</b></f>
  <br></br>
People with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development:
Three types: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and a combination of the two.

  <em>Inattention</em>: is not being able to carefully complete a task, pay attention, think about, listen to, or watch someone or something.

  <em>Impulsivity</em>: Acting on sudden desires, ideas, or feelings rather than from careful thought.
<br></br>
  <b><f>Understanding ADHD Symptoms in Women</f></b>
  <br></br>
Here are some ways that ADHD might show up in your life:

  <ul class="body">
    <li>-Your desk at work is piled high with papers. Even when you make a big effort to tidy it, it only stays clear for a day or two.
Being at the office feels difficult. The noise and people make it hard to get work done. </li>
  <li>-You often stay late at the office, as the only time you can work well is when everyone else has left and it's quiet.</li>
  <br></br>
  <li>-You spend a lot of time and effort to look "normal," and hope no one notices the real you.</li>

  </ul>

<p><em>Many women are relieved to learn that behaviors they have been struggling with for so long are because of ADHD.</em></p>

<ul class="body">
  <li>Substance use disorders, such as alcohol or drugs</li>
  <li>Sleep disorders</li>
  <li>Eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia</li>
  <li>Mood disorders, like depression or bipolar disorder</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>How to seek medical health:</b></p>
If you think you might have <em>ADHD</em>, it's important to be diagnosed by a healthcare professional. An accurate diagnosis and treatment will allow you to get relief from your symptoms and greatly improve the quality of your life.
