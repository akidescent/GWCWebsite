  <f><strong><h1>ADHD</strong></f></h1>
<br></br>
  <hr noshade color="black"></hr>
    <b>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</b> is a brain disorder marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with life.
  <hr noshade color="black"></hr>
<br></br>

<p><f><b>How it affects women</b></p></f>

  <em>Males</em> tend to have the hyperactive/impulsive kind, which may cause them to be fidgety, interrupt others, have mood swings, and be impatient.
<br></br>
  <em>Females</em> have a tendency to exhibit the inattentive type, which makes it hard to focus, pay attention to details, listen, and remember things.

<f><b>Symptoms:</b></f>
  <br></br>
    People with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development:
    Three types of symptoms: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and a combination of the two.
    <br></br>
    <em>Inattention</em>: Not being able to carefully complete a task, pay attention, think about, listen to, or watch someone or something.
  <br></br>
    <em>Impulsivity</em>: Acting on sudden desires, ideas, or feelings rather than from careful thought.
  <br></br>
    <b><f>Understanding ADHD Symptoms in Women</f></b>
  <br></br>
    Here are some ways that ADHD might show up in your life:

  <ul type="circle" class="body">
    <p><li>> Your desk at work is piled high with papers. Even when you make a big effort to tidy it, it only stays clear for a day or two.</li><p>
    <p><li>> Being at the office feels difficult. The noise and people make it hard to get work done. </li></p>
    <p><li>> You often stay late at the office, as the only time you can work well is when everyone else has left and it's quiet.</li></p>
    <p><li>> You spend a lot of time and effort to look "normal," and hope no one notices the real you.</li></p>

  </ul>
<hr noshade color="black"></hr>

<p><em><h1>Many women are relieved to learn that behaviors they have been struggling with for so long are because of ADHD.</em></p></h1>

  <hr noshade color="black"></hr>

  <b><f>Along with ADHD</f></b>
<br></br>
  <p>When you have more than one condition, they are called
  <em>comorbid conditions</em> or coexisting conditions. Here are some conditions that women often have in addition to their ADHD:</p>
    <br>> Substance use disorders, such as alcohol or drugs</br>
    <br>> Sleep disorders</br>
    <br>> Eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia</br>
    <br>> Mood disorders, like depression or bipolar disorder</br>
  </ul>

  If you think you might have <em>ADHD</em>, it's important to be diagnosed by a healthcare professional. An accurate diagnosis and treatment will allow you to get relief from your symptoms and greatly improve the quality of your life.
