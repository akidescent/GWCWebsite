<h1> Anxiety</h1>

<h2>
  <b>  How to seek medical health</b>
</h2>

<p>
  Seeing your primary care provider is the first step to seeking help for a diagnosis. Your primary healthcare provider
 can check for underlying physical symptoms that you or someone you know may be having.
    Although seeing your primary care provider is good for diagnosis, seeing a psychiatrist for severe anxiety can be more beneficial as they specialize in the diagnosis and 
  treatment of mental health conditions.
