<p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  Seeing your primary care provider is the first step for seeking help for being diagnosed
   for your anxiety.  They can check for underlying physical symptoms that you or someone you know may be having.
    <br></br>
    Although, seeing your primary care provider is good for diagnosis, seeing a psychiatrist  for severe anxiety, and
    diagnosing, can be more beneficial as they specialize in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions.
