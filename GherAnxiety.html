<center>Anxiety</center>



<p>Anxiety is a real disorder that can cause an intense feeling of fear or worry that
  affects women in everyday situations. Anxiety can often cause intense feelings of fear,
    anxiety, and/or terror during repetitive episodes known as Panic Attacks.

    <br></br>
    Women are twice as likely than men to be diagnosed and affected with anxiety during their lifetime.
        <em>Diagnoses can be early as childhood or teenage years that continue during adulthood. </em>

  <b>How to seek medical health</b>
</h2>

<p>
  Seeing your primary care provider is the first step for seeking help for being diagnosed
   for your anxiety.  They can check for underlying physical symptoms that you or someone you know may be having.
    <br></br>
    Although, seeing your primary care provider is good for diagnosis, seeing a psychiatrist  for severe anxiety, and
    diagnosing, can be more beneficial as they specialize in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions.
